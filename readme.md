# Crypto Failures Demo Challenge

## Introduction

Where we left off, we saw an example of a hard-coded key being placed in the code base. This is obviously a big **NO NO**, we already know that. For the past while, we have been using environment variables to ensure we don't do that kind of thing.

## Task

Take some time to research what other ways or additional things we can do/ use along with environment variables (you may find we have already been doing some others) so that we are not exposing keys and other sensitive information in our code base. Write up a small paragraph (4-6 sentences) about what you have found. This can be submitted to me via Teams or school email.
